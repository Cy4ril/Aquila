        <h1><em>JSAcademy Experiment</em></h1>
        <p>Demonstrating my understanding of images,list both unordered and vice.<br>
        Use of different tags like "forms" instead of the div tags.<br>
    Lets begin then with the image of a car, which i love very much.</p>
    <img src:"car".......>
    <p>To get a full understanding of how it works during the class!<br>
    I pray a space appears above the doc for the image i was to insert.<br>
I am adding this text just trying to reach a milestone code amount of <strong>50 codes hehehe.</strong><br>
So we go now to the assignment proper!,normally it was the whole idea behind the web page.<br>
<strong>Before i decided to experiment on the acquired knowledge!.</strong></p>
        <hr>
        <form>
            Username: <input type="text" placeholder="User ID"/><br>
            Password: <input type="Password" placeholder="Password"/><br>
            <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
        <p>Another question just poped in,how is the site inserted to where the submision is done<br>
